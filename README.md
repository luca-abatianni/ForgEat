## Premise

In a magical world, a group of powerful wizards had WAY too much fun one night.
Come morning, all they could think about was eating a healthy meal to set themselves straight.\
But in the state they were in, would they be able to discern and remember what was food...*from what wasnâ€™t?*\
And would their hunger lead them to use their magics against each other to fill out their belly?\
Food can disguise itself, memory can trick you, hunger can lead you to do unimaginable things.\
Your only goal is to fill your belly before your enemies, **whatever it takes**.
